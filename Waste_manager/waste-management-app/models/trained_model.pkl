The file /waste-management-app/waste-management-app/models/trained_model.pkl is a binary file that will contain the serialized trained machine learning model. As such, it cannot be represented in text format. 

To create this file, you would typically use a library like `pickle` or `joblib` in Python to save your trained model after training it in your model training notebook. 

For now, this file is intentionally left blank as it will be generated programmatically after training the model.
