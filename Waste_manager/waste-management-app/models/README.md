# Model Documentation for Waste Management App

This directory contains the trained machine learning model for garbage classification, specifically designed to categorize waste into four categories: organic, plastic, metal/glass, and paper.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture includes several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and it concludes with fully connected layers to output the classification results.

## Training Process

The model was trained using the Kaggle garbage classification dataset. The training process involved the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model generalization.
2. **Model Training**: The model was trained using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam).
3. **Validation**: The model's performance was validated using a separate validation set to monitor overfitting.

## Usage

To use the trained model for predictions, follow these steps:

1. Load the model using the appropriate library (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch).
2. Preprocess the input image in the same way as the training data.
3. Use the model to predict the category of the image.

Example code snippet for loading and using the model:

```python
import joblib

# Load the trained model
model = joblib.load('trained_model.pkl')

# Preprocess the input image
# (Add your image preprocessing code here)

# Make a prediction
predictions = model.predict(preprocessed_image)
```

## Conclusion

This README provides an overview of the model architecture, training process, and usage instructions for the waste management application. For further details, refer to the associated notebooks and source code in the project.
