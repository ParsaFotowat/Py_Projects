# 3DES CBC Encryption/Decryption Streamlit App

This web app provides a simple, interactive interface for encrypting and decrypting messages using the 3DES (Triple DES) algorithm in CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode. It is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and uses [PyCryptodome](https://www.pycryptodome.org/) for cryptographic operations.

## Features

- **3DES CBC Encryption:** Enter any plaintext message and encrypt it using three independent 8-byte keys.
- **3DES CBC Decryption:** Paste the IV and ciphertext to decrypt and recover the original message.
- **Key Management:** Generate random keys or input your own keys in hexadecimal format.
- **Base64 Encoding:** IV and ciphertext are displayed in base64 for easy copy-paste and sharing.
- **Side-by-side UI:** Encrypt and decrypt panels are visible at the same time for convenience.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ParsaFotowat/Py_Projects/tree/master/3DES_CBC
    cd your-repo/3DES_CBC
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
